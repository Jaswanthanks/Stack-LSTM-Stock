Stack LSTM Stock Prediction for Apple Stocks

Welcome to the Stack LSTM Stock Prediction project for Apple stocks. This project aims to use Stack LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict the stock prices of Apple Inc. This project leverages deep learning techniques to forecast potential trends in Apple stock prices, facilitating informed decision-making for traders and investors.

When creating a post for your GitHub project on the Stack LSTM stock prediction for Apple stocks, it's essential to provide valuable and comprehensive information for potential users and collaborators

STEPS FOR STACKED LSTM: 

1. We will collect the stock data
2. Proprocess the data to train and test data
3. Create an stacked LSTM model 
4. Predict the test data and plot the output 
5. Predict the future 30 days and plot the output
